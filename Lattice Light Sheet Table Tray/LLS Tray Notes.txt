Lattice Light Sheet table tray
Catches those tiny screws and coverslips and keeps them from falling into your optical table.

This fits the 3i implementation on an Imperial table top.  Is secured with 1/4"-20 screws at the obvious places.

Made from two parts.  These stack on top of one another to provide a small lip around the edge of the tray.  You could get away with just the Bottom piece but lose the lip.  

We had this laser cut from 3 mm acrylic at a total cost of ~$50 AUD.
