This repo holds a number of parts created for an optical/fluorescence microscopy lab.  These parts don't warrant a repo of their own, but some or all may be useful for others doing similar work.  

Happy to send source CAD files of any that may be desired.  If you do come up with similar or derivative parts of your own it'd be great to have them included in this repo, either in your own fork or adding as a contributor.
