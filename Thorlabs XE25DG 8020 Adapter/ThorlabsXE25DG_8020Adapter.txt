Adapter to use Thorlabs XE25DG drill alignment tool with 80/20 25 mm extrusion.  Stock Thorlabs part has a milled plate that slides into extrusion slot and clamps with supplied screw.  This doesn't fit into common 80/20 25 mm extrusion slots, but with this part replacing the milled piece it does.  

Unscrew the old one and screw this one in to use.  Part is plastic with threads which works, but is prone to stripping.  Good thing it's cheap to print a new one when that happens!

Printed on a Zortrax M200 w/ Z-UltraT filament, 0.19 mm layer height, and medium infill, though these are quite flexible.
