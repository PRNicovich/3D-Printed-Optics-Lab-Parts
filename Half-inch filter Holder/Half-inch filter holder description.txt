Holder for half-inch (12.5 mm) excitation filters.  

Originally designed for NicoLase block to go in front of OBIS diode lasers (Coherent) holding Semrock bandpass filters.  Should work for any filter maker up to ~5 mm thick and any laser diode with beam height at 3/4" (19.05 mm) from base (eg Vortran Stradus).  Filter is centered on this 3/4" axis. 

Base mounts to table or heat sink block with M4 screws.  Filter is held in place in holder with filter holder face, which is secured to holder with 3 x M2 screws and nuts.  No reason comparable imperial sizes won't work. 

STEP file is included in repo if you want to modify design for other sizes or mount heights. 

Printed on Zortrax M200 w/ Z-UltraT, 0.09 mm layer height, and light infill.  Print with eventual optical axis perpenticular to build plate for strength and minimal support material.
