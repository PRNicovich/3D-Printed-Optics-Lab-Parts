Cable Anchor for optical tables or extruded T-slot channel (think 80/20 or any of the similar suppliers).  

Holds a reasonable-sized bundle of cables (up to ~35 mm or 1.5") for up to 5 mm cable ties. Hole fits a M6 or 1/4" button or cap-head socket screw.  Screw the part to the table, lay cables over, then add some cable ties.  

Print in same orientation as will be mounted results in some support material that's a little tricky to remove, but seems to be the best option.  Printed with a Zortrax M200, Z-UltraT filament, 0.19 mm layer height and medium infill, though these parameters are most likely very tolerant to other settings.
